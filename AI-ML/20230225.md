# Im starting my journey to learn AI, ML and Data Science. These are my curren resources.
1. http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com
2. Intro to Machine Learning with Python
3. The Little Learner, A straight line to Deep Learning
4. Openai's ChatGPT
5. Linear Algebra, Theory - Intuition - Code
6. Norman Wildberger videos on youtube
7. Some other youtube explanations

## Intro
My path has me starting with deep learning and understanding the fundamental concept of a "Perceptron".
I was lucky to land on this topic early since the concept of a Perceptron is very similar to a logic gate, which I've done some studying on and 
am familiar with. This is a great starting point. 

## Some thoughts
Some initial thoughts on this. It seems like this is a new (at least to me) kind of computing paradigm. It's a new way to think of computation,
and problem solving.  

## Some Details
Weight = w
Input = x
Bias = b
Output = out
Formula = w * x + b = out
