## Intro
My path has me starting with deep learning and understanding the fundamental concept of a "Perceptron".
I was lucky to land on this topic early since the concept of a Perceptron is very similar to a logic gate, which I've done some studying on and 
am familiar with. This is a great starting point. 

## Some thoughts
Some initial thoughts on this. It seems like this is a new (at least to me) kind of computing paradigm. It's a new way to think of computation,
and problem solving.  

## Some Details
* Perceptrons = The neuron of deep learning, similar to a logic gate.
* Weight = w
* Input = x
* Bias = b
* Output = out
* Formula = w * x + b = out
